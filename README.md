API's 101

What is an API, what does it stand for?

    Application Programming Interface
    
    1969 = Arpanet (DOD - Advanced Projects Research Agency), Closed Network
    1971 = Internet - primarily universities and research institutions
        - smtp (email)
        - ftp (file transfer protocol)
        - telnet (virtualize a remote server session) entering shell commands
        - ssh (allowed you to do the same thing as telnet, but securely)
    
    1991 - HTTP/HTML created by TBL (Tim Berners Lee)
            the inventor of the World Wide Web
                first demonstrated on a NEXT computer at MIT
            - Websites (BUT, Static information)

            Pre-API

            use case: Travelers
                travel phone books
                travel diskettes (databases program)
                travel CD's (databases program)

                the problem with serving this data via websites was that the data was static.

    API = Practical Definition
        an application interface that allows an external device to access internal server DATABASES/DATA via well defined CRUD (Creat, Read, Update, Delete) methods.  
        
        The most of these methods is (R) Read.  Which is called a GET request.

        XHR 

        REST API's utilize XHR

        Use XMLHttpRequest (XHR) objects to interact with servers. You can retrieve data from a URL without having to do a full page refresh. This enables a Web page to update just part of a page without disrupting what the user is doing. XMLHttpRequest is used heavily in AJAX programming.  NOTE: XML is no longer actually used.  XML has been replaced by JSON objects.

        Constructor
        XMLHttpRequest()
        The constructor initializes an XMLHttpRequest. It must be called before any other method calls.
